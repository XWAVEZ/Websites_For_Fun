        Welcome to HTML <br>
        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.<br>
        You can use the br tag to break/ display something in another line.
        <!-- So, quite easy and simple, right? If you have doubts in something like this, you probably live under a rock. --><br>
         You can also use comment lines to add a line of text which can only be seen here and not on the web page.<br>
         It is used for our own reference. To do so, use the shortcut ctrl + / or type "< !-- -- >"<br>
         <!-- Gl friend on your coding joruney. -->
          This is just the start, you have much more to learn.
